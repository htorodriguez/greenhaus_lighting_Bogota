# greenhouse_lighting_Bogota
Is it worth introducing artifical lightinging greenhouses for vegetable growth in Bogota- Colombia?

This Notebook adresses this question by breaking it down into the following three questions
 1) what are the average hours of light per day in the region of Bogota
 2) how much energy in forms of usable photons per square meter are shining in the region per day 
 3) is there an influence if the inmediate enviroments is rather urban (for rooftop gardening) or rather rural (for large scale production)
 
The data chosen to address these questions is data from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) available at https://maps.nrel.gov/nsrdb-viewer

This repository contains 2 files

- a jupyter Notebook
- a sample of the dataset used. To run the notebook unzip the folder. The complete dataset (around 800MB) can be downloaded from the NSRDB website chosing following coordinates
  - Bogota city: (4.77, -74.02) to (4.49, -74.18)
  - Northern rural region (4.81, -74.14) to (4.97, -73.94)
